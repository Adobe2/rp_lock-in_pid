Both Lock-in amplifiers have their own internal oscillators for reference signals.
They can also be used as function generator for any other purpose.

## Harmonic functions

The harmonic functions are built into an array of 2520 points of 14 bits signed int stored in Read
Only Memory (ROM) modules in the FPGA layer.

![Harmonic Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/harmonic_mods.png "Harmonic Functions")

All of them are discretized versions of $$cos(\omega t)$$, $$sin(\omega t)$$, $$cos(\omega t + \phi)$$, $$cos(2 \omega t + \phi)$$ and
$$cos(3 \omega t + \phi)$$. The discretization was carefully made in a way that all the Fourier orthogonality
relations between them are kept when $$\phi = 0$$.

The `phase` parameter controls the steps of delay between `cos_ref` and `cos_?f` signals and is used to set $$\phi$$ value.

The `period` parameter (`hp` inside FPGA) is the number of internal FPGA clock periods that last each point
of the array. The min value of `hp=0` means each points corresponds to a clock period (8 ns), making the
full Cosinus period of $$ \frac{1}{2520 \cdot 8 ns}  = 49.6 kHz$$. With `hp=1`, each point last 16 ns, an so on.

$$ Period = (hp+1) \cdot 8 ns$$

### Schematics of FPGA layer
The following graphic represents the FPGA logic circuit for the harmonic functions generation.
It's not rigorous, for simplicity. Lets you understand the way the parameters affects the generated
functions.

Each function is stored in a ROM module. The ROM outputs the value stored in the position
set by the `addr` input.

The `addr` input of the ROM modules for `cos_ref` and `sin_ref` is labeled `cnt` an is fed by a counter that
goes from 0 to 2519 and start again. The counter changes is value at the time rate set by the frequency
divider thats lowers down the frequency of the FPGA internal clock (125 MHz). The lower value mean no division
at all.

The memory modules address for  `cos_f?` functions are fed by the same `cnt` number minus `phase`, so they are
phase shifted respect to `cos_ref` and `sin_ref`. The phase parameter of the Web App control this.

## Square functions

The square functions are build on the run. They work as frequency dividers applied to the internal FPGA clock ( frequency: 125 MHz , period: 8 ns).

![Square Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/square_mods.png "Square Functions")

There are three binary signals (`sq_ref_b`, `sq_quad_b` and `sq_phas_b`) controlled by two parameters
(unsigned int `sqp` and `phase_sq`). If `sqp==0`, the binary signal is taken from
the sign bit of an harmonic signal (`sq_ref_b` from `cos_ref`, `sq_quad_b` from `sin_ref`). In that case, square and harmonic oscillators are synchronized.
When `sqp>0`, the period of square signals is: $$ ({\color{var}\text{sqp}}+1) \cdot 2 \cdot 8 ns $$.
So, `sqp+1` is the number of clock ticks of half period.

The `sq_quad_b` signal is in quadrature respect to `sq_ref_b` and is delayed by a quarter period:
`(sqp+1)/2` clock ticks. The division has not decimal digits, so the real quadrature is achieved only on
odd values of `sqp`. The difference is only relevant on high accuracy lock-in measurements or in high frequency uses (when the relative difference in period is higher).

The `sq_phas_b` signal delayed by `phase_sq` clock ticks respect to `sq_ref_b` and is useful for
arbitrary phase setup.

Three 14 bits signed signals are built from binary signals: `sq_ref`, `sq_quad` and `sq_phas` respectively. These are actually used for demodulation and for output. Each `0` is mapped to
`-4096` and each  `1` to `4096`, which means an output value of Â±0.5 V.

### Schematics of FPGA layer

The following graphic represents the FPGA logic circuit for the square functions generation.
Again, it's not rigorous, for simplicity.

![Square Functions FPGA]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/gen_mod2_square.png "Square Functions FPGA")

The three signals are built from clock signals using some frequency dividers and delay modules.

<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#Schematics_of_FPGA_layer_square" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="Schematics_of_FPGA_layer_square">detailed description<span class="caret"></span></a>

<div id="Schematics_of_FPGA_layer_square" class="collapse" markdown="1" style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid gray; border-radius: 5px;">

The clock signal (square signal of 125 MHz frequency / 8 ns period) is lowered down by two
frequency dividers: divided by 2 and by $$ ({\color{var}\text{sqp}}+1) $$.
The higher frequency is achieved at `sqp=1`:
$$ 31.25 \; \text{MHz} \;=\; \frac{125 \; \text{MHz}}{ 4 } $$ .

`sq_ref_b` refers to *reference* signal. The signal `sq_quad_b` is delayed
to be in quadrature respect to `sq_ref_b`. The delay is
$$ (\frac{\color{var}\text{sqp}}{2}+1) $$ clock ticks length (the division is done by the
shift operator`sqp>>1`,  whose result has not decimal digits and rounds all to
the lower integer value).

The `sq_phas_b` signal is delayed by `phase_sq` clock ticks length.

## Web Frontend

In the Lock-in panel, both oscillators can be configured.

Under the *Slow harmonic lock-in* section you can set the fpga `hp` parameter using the
**Period** control, and the fpga `phase` parameter using the **Phase** control.

Under the *Fast square lock-in* section you can set the fpga `sqp` parameter using the
**Period** control, and the fpga `phase_sq` parameter using the **Phase** control.

All the controls are configured using unsigned int values and a human-readable value is shown
below to make it easier to understand.
