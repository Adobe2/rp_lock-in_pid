The Oscilloscope instrument lets you see the wave form of two signals
of the device. They can be internal signals (produced inside the FPGA module)
or external (taken through ADC inputs).

## The original application

As was said, this instrument is based in the
[scope application](https://github.com/RedPitaya/RedPitaya/tree/release-v0.95/apps-free/scope))
of the Free Software repository for the Red Pitaya Comunity.
All the controls of the original application were kept in the right hand column.
In these panels you can control the trigger behavior, the time and amplitude scales,
monitor the statistics for each channel, etc. Only the *"Monitor"* panel is new, used
for the PIDs instrument.

The original application was designed to measure only de ADC inputs. This version was modified
to use de oscilloscope functionality on other signals. The controls for this purposes are in the
left panel.

## Selection of signals

The main new feature of the oscilloscope application is the posibility to choose which signal you
want to view. You can do this from the left panel called "Oscilloscope".

These are the signal available to view:

## External trigger

The original application lets you use an external signal to trigger the oscilloscope
acquisition. Here you can select where this external trigger comes from. The options
are specified in this table:

| Trigger option       | Source    | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None                 | -         | Never triggers                                                           |
| Pin                  | Hardware  | The trigger is taken from pin DIO0_P of RedPitaya hardware digital input |
| Ramp floor           | Ramp      | Triggers when Ramp A signal reachs the minimum value                     |
| Ramp Ceil            | Ramp      | Triggers when Ramp A signal reachs the maximun value                     |
| Harmonic Mod.        | Lock-in   | Triggers with cos_ref start point                                        |
| Square Mod.          | Lock-in   | Triggers with sq_ref start point                                         |
| Out of Lock          | Auto-lock | Triggers when auto-lock system doesn't achieve the locked condition      |
| Jump Trigger         | Auto-lock | Still not implemented                                                    |
| Lock control Trigger | Auto-lock | Triggers when auto-lock system finds the "start locking" condition       |


## Anti-aliasing filter

The oscilloscope FPGA implementation includes anti-aliasing filters that are useful in several
situations but may distort the real signal wave form in others situations. The effect over is similar to a low-pass filter applied to both channels. This filters can be disabled for a more precise
representation of the measured signal.


## R and Phase switch

When this option is switched on, the selected OscA and OscB inputs are pre-processed before
been displayed as Channel1 and Channel2 in the plot area:

```C
Channel1  =  sqrt( OscA**2 + OscB**2 ) ;
Channel2  =  atan2(OscB,OscA) ;
```

In this way, if you choose `OscA=Xo` , `OscB=Yo` , the displayed Channel1 and Channel2 in
the plot area are the R and Î¦ respectively:

$$ R = \sqrt{ X^2 + Y^2 } $$

$$ \phi = atan \left ( - \frac{Y}{X} \right ) $$

## Other Features

The top button bar includes some other features to control de visualization
![top button bar]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/up_buttons.png "Top Button Bar")

 - **Autoscale:** Scales the vertical axis to use the whole screen on displayed data.
 - **Reset zoom:** Resets the zoom options to default.
 - **ChannelX buttons:** Switch on/off the visualization of Channel X
 - **Stop:** Stops data acquisition .
 - **Save data:** Displays a modal windows with options to exporte the visualized data to Python/Numpy, Matlab/Octave or CSV .


## Some technical information

  - The oscilloscope internal memory for each channel is a 16384 length array of 14 bits signet int numbers. For data visualization in
the web frontend this array is decimated to a 1024 length and converted to float type. When you save data using the web application
you only save this 1024 arrays. For higher precision you would need to acquire the data using scripting tools.

- The Wep App is constantly asking the web server for curves and parameters update, waiting 50 ms between each query.

- The parameters of the application are updated to the web frontend if they change in the FPGA through scripting tools. So yopu can use a mixed control scheme, if you want.

- Each time the Web App query for new data the FPGA oscilloscope module
starts a new triggered acquisition. If you wan to use a mixed scheme and acquire
channels with the scripting tools, first you have to stop the web app for a while.
